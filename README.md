# Wicked-Problems

## A brief introduction about me
My name is Jiacheng Shi, which is a Chinese and might be hard to pronounce, so just call me Alfred, which is my preferred English name. I am from Shanghai, China. I like to listen music, watch Japanese Animes and play trumpet. Hopefully I could learn the basic language of computer, because I know nothing before I came to college. Computer programming will be a big part of our life in the future so I wish that through this lesson I could at least step my foot into this field.
